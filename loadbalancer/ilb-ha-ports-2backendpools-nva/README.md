# Standard load balancer in HA ports with two backend pools
Here's an Azure ARM template to create a VNet with an internal standard load balancer (ILB) in HA ports to create a configuration with NVAs in high avaiability.
For resiliency, the Azure VMs associated with every backend pool have an assigned availability set.


The network diagram is reported below:

The nva1, nva2, nva3, nva4 run with linux VMs, with ip forwarding enabled. The replacement of NVAs with simple linux VMs is useful for to troubleshooting to verify the traffic flows pass through the NVAs.
The internal load balancer with frontend IPs and backend pools is show above:

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Before spinning up the ARM template you should set the Azure subscription name in the file **ilb-ha.ps1**
>* Deploy the ARM template by following powershell command:

#### <a name="EnableIPForwarding"></a>1. Setup in nva1, nva2, nva3 and nva4 VMs
Enable ip forwarding on nva1, nva2, nva3, nva4:

```bash
    # sed -i -e '$a\net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' /etc/sysctl.conf
    # systemctl restart network.service
```

The ARM template sets two heath check probes on port 80. The ILB forwards the traffic to a nva, only if the nva answers to health probe messages. It is mandatory for the setup install and enable an HTTP daemon on the NVAs.
Run the following steps to install apache httpd daemon on nva1, nva2, nva3, nva4:

```bash
    # yum -y install httpd
    # systemctl enable httpd.service    (enable the httpd daemon for the next reboot)
    # systemctl restart httpd.service   (start the httpd daemon)
```

#### <a name="Iperf3"></a>2. Install the iperf3 in vm3, vm4, vm5 and vm4

```bash
     # yum -y install iperf3
```


#### <a name="Iperf3"></a>3.1 Checking the TCP flows transit between vm3 and vm4

To generate the TCP flows from vm3 to vm4:

```bash
    [root@vm3 ~]# iperf3 -P 80 -c 10.0.3.10 -t 60 -i 1 -f m -p 6001       (iperf client)
    [root@vm4 ~]# iperf3 -s -p 6001                                       (iperf server)
```

Based on the static routes (UDRs) set in the subnet3,subnet4 the following flows transit are established:

**vm3 -> FrontEndIP1 -> nva1 (OR nva2) -> FrontEndIP2 -> nva3 (or nva4) -> vm4**

**vm4 -> FrontEndIP2 -> nva3 (OR nva4) -> FrontEndIP1 -> nva1 (or nva2) -> vm3**

The traffic in transit in NVAs can be verified by tcpdump:

```bash
     tcpdump -nn -qt -i eth0 port 6001
```

#### <a name="Iperf3"></a>3.2 Checking the TCP flows transit between vm3 and vm5

**vm3 -> FrontEndIP1 -> nva1 (OR nva2) -> FrontEndIP2 -> nva3 (or nva4) -> vm5**
[![5]][5]

**vm5 -> FrontEndIP2 -> nva1 (OR nva2) -> FrontEndIP2 -> nva3 (or nva4) -> vm3**
[![6]][6]


#### <a name="Iperf3"></a>3.3 Checking the TCP flows transit between vm4 and vm5

**vm4 -> FrontEndIP2 -> nva3 (OR nva4) -> vm5**
[![7]][7]

**vm5 -> FrontEndIP2 -> nva3 (OR nva4) -> vm4**
